# md_parser.sh

This bash script parses the headers of a markdown file and creates a new file for every header found. It also dumps all content under that header into the file. This script was written for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Using this, I propogate my MOC file containing brief information about academic journals into a web view in Obsidian's graph view.

The script only works on level 1 headers with asterisks on either side of the name, like so:


```
# *Geographical Analysis* 

~content~

```

This script was created using Chat GPT. I have copied and pasted the entire log of my interaction with Chat GPT into a text file.
